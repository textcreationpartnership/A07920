            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Scots-tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> who was he avily troubled with a diſeaſe, which the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and greateſt Phyſicians in that place, called a
<hi>Carnoſitie in the urinall paſſage,</hi> (though it proved in end to be a very hard one, and turned in a ſtone) the which to cure, they applyed many good and laudable medicaments, without prevailing any thing againſt his diſeaſe. At length deſpairing of health: he is ſent to the waters of Tunbridge, as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s laſt refuge. With whom amongſt others I went: where, by the uſe of theſe waters, his paine was mitigate and aboundance of ſlimy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors voyded: from thence he went to Paris, where he was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ordained to go to the Well of Spaw in Germany, and from thence to Knesbrough in England: by the uſe of all which waters, he is come to be expert, and to have full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of the nature and vertues of ſuch minerall waters.</p>
            <p>In the mean time of theſe voyages, my ſtudy was of that
<pb facs="tcp:26125:3"/>kinde of fountains: remembring from my childhood, in ſome kinde, the affinity of the taſte of the Well of Peter-head, with that which I did finde in thole Wells, whereof now I have ſpoken, I reſolved to come and try the vertues and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of that Well. Which firſt the inhabitants of that town of Peter-head manifeſted to me, by their relation of its curing of ſore eyes, looſing of the belly, if bound, &amp; ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the immoderate courſe thereof, ſerving to them for a cup of preparation before dinner, with many other ſuch like experiences: as one, which I think not amiſſe to inſert in this place of an old, ancient, grave man of 76. years experience, yet living, who diverſe and often times hath told me, that he himſelf being uſually troubled with ſand and ſtones in the kidneys, uſed many kindes of drogues, to free him from this fearfull and conſuming deſeaſe: at laſt being vehemently vexed with paine, took ſome 5. or 6. draughts of this water, after which, there burſt out with his urine, great quantitie of ſand and ſtones. Which water thus he did drink 8 dayes altogether, every morning, with the like effects, and hath never been troubled hithertils, with ſo vehement paine.</p>
            <p>Another in that ſame town, who voyded his ſtomach of a ſtone, bigger then a tennis ball <hi>per anum,</hi> and I think it was, the great antipathie which this water hath againſt ſtones or ſand, in all places of the body, that made him ſo evacuate ſuch a monſtrous thing as this.</p>
            <p>Yet not content to know the truth hereof, and that the vertues of this water were great by ſome experiences: I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to dive in the deepeſt of this fountaine, by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary tryals of ſuch waters: as the drawing of the tincture of a nutgall, which it will do in the twinckling of an eye, with many other pretty little tryals of that ſort: as in all of them it proved excellent.</p>
            <p>Neither yet confident of my own tryals, I carryed the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this ſource, to the ſource and fountain, from whence my firſt knowledge in medicine did ſlow: and from whom, many in this nation have received the moſt part of their <pb facs="tcp:26125:4"/>knowledge, both divine and Philoſophicall, which water was keept half year, then tried and found neither changed in taſte nor ſmell, as yet it remaineth in that ſame ſtate after two years: and by his adviſe, information, and ordinance I cauſed pur this clear, pure wholeſome water in a veſſell, which after a little boyling, was coagulate in a red or brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh tincture. (like that of Plin. chap. 2. lib. 3, <hi>Tungria, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas Galliae, fontem habet inſignem, plurimis bullis stillantem, ferruginei ſaporis, quod ipſum non niſi in fine potus intelligitur.

Eadem aqua igni admota, turbida fit, ac poſtremo ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcit.</hi>) In the bottome of which veſſel, after evaporation remained a red kinde of matter, like unto <hi>colcothar,</hi> which was calcined, pulveriſed, and diſſolved with common water: the water being ſeparate from the ſediment by inclination, and evaporate there remained in the bottome a perfect vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, of a greeniſh colour, and of taſte ſharp and ſweet: the vitriol by concoction within the earth, having turned its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive acrimonie, in a good ſweet aciditie, <hi>ideo aquae therma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les omnes, qua ſolutam vitrioli materiam fixam, eamque cocta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſubdulcem, ſine ſuo humido complectuntur, caeteris omnibus praeſtant: quod materia illa fixa vitrioli, humido radicali fixo auri &amp; argenti respondeat, cui infinitas occultas virtutes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe tota credidit antiquitas. inquit Fabet.

            </p>
            <p>The ſediment which remained after ſeparation of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by inclination, being again tried in the fire, proved to be a confuſed maſſe of not perfectly cancocted mettals.</p>
            <p>But none can ſpeak more by experience, of the goodneſſe and vertue of this fountaine, then the gentleman, I have named, and another gentleman of good worth, <hi>M. Thomas Aikinhead,</hi> Commiſſar of Edinburgh, who in Auguſt laſt, <hi>An.</hi> 1635. did find in this Well, as much worth, as they found in any of the forementioned exotick Wells, having tryed both. And not only thoſe, but many other gentlemen of good reſpect can teſtifie theſe things to be true, which in this booke, I have written, concerning the medicinall vertues of this <pb facs="tcp:26125:4"/>fountaine: which, good reader, I hope you may patiently read, and thank God; if, diſeaſed, you reap any benefit from hence.</p>
            <p>Neither had I intention to have publiſhed this treatiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious of my own weakneſſe, if I had not been ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and encouraged thereto by a letter, which I receaved from my learned Maſter, whom I ſhall reverence, with a filial reſpect ſo long as breath ſhall delay to expire.</p>

            <head>S. PETERS WELL, <hi>OR</hi> THE WELL OF Peter-head.</head>
            <p>MEdicinall waters differ much in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and taſte: ſome of them being ſulfureous, ſome vitriolate, ſome ſaltiſh: yet all of them
<hi>communi nomine</hi> are called <hi>acidi,</hi> from the taſte: which acidity or ſharpneſſe comes partly from vitrioll and partly from the ſalt of minerals: or they are called mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall waters becauſe paſſing through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities of the earth, they carry with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tinctures of what they renconter, and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate with the quinteſſence of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals by which they paſſe whether it bee <hi>terra lemnia, bol. armen. chalk:</hi> or congeled liquors an juyces, as <hi>allome, ſuccin, ſulphur, nitre, vitriol &amp;c.</hi> or mettals, as gold, ſilver, yron, &amp;c. or ſtones as chriſtall, marble, load-ſtone &amp;c: they are alſo called medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall waters for their rare and admirable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in curing diſeaſes and preſerving of <pb facs="tcp:26125:6"/>health. Many of theſe waters are found out by the diligent ſearching and induſtrious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the learned, endevouring to find out the ſecrets of nature moſt eaſie for the help of mankind; as the wel of Spaw in Germany, the wells of Burbon, of Pouges, of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in France, of Porrecta in Italy, of Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and Knesbrough, in England with many others of infinite vertues, as Plinius recordeth in many paſſages of his books, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the 2. chap. of his 31. book. And I would that any reader who doubts of the excellent vertues of infinite diverſity of waters ſhould read that chapter: And now our waters of Peter-head called be our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Saint Peters wel thinking that it was S. Peter that ſent from Rome a facultie of curing diſeaſes to theſe waters, becauſe hee himſelf could not come, being imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout more neceſſary affaires at Rome, for the time Pope. Wherefore to gratify this holy Apoſtle they have built a temple, which to this day is called S. Peters church. They uſed to come to the well on S. Peters day, aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves in great mulitudes; on which <pb facs="tcp:26125:6"/>day as yet we have a great faire at this place. But this is meer ſuperſtition, like that of the heathen, who as Plinius teſtifieth lib. 31. chap. 2. denominate their rare and medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall waters from diverſe of there gods.</p>
            <p>S. Peters well may be compared with Spaw waters, being nothing inferiour to them in medicinal vertues, and far excells any other as yet found out, in Europe.</p>
            <p>It is certain that this Petrean water (for ſo hereafter ſhal it be called) paſſes through minerals: but with what proportion they are mixed in theſe ſubterranean cells, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know, or whether it be hote or cold, moiſt or dry, ſome thinges from whence it flows being hote, ſome cold, ſome temperate, ſeeming rather that it is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, well mixed, as its effects ſhows: yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes this water while it is drunken hume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates and refrigerates, incontinent, being daunted through the heat of the ſtomach, heats and dryes.</p>
            <p>For the vertues of our water: it cleanſeth and waſteth viſcide &amp; Tartareous humors, extenuats pituite, it voyds the liver, melt,
<pb facs="tcp:26125:7"/>meſaraicks, and other our entrails, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever obſtructions is troubleſome to them: it ſtrengthens the ſtomach ſo, be its aſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that none can complain of harme by its actuall coldneſſe: It gives ſtrength to the nerves, tempers the heat of the kidneys, cleanſing and expelling their gravell, ſand and ſtones more forceably then any other medicament, becauſe it is diuretick, ſimple, naturall, voyd of all arte, made by the hand of God alone, and moſt gracious to the taſte it hinders the concretion or coagulation of ſand, reſiſting the generation of confirmed ſtones; and if confirmed, diminiſhes them: it purgeth the bladder and mundifies the ſtone of viſcide pituit and mucoſitie wherewith it is environed, prepairing it to be eaſily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out by cutting, it is moſt profitable for the ulcer of the reins and carnoſities in the urinal paſſage, caſt in be injection: it certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly helps the venerean &amp; Virulent Gonorhea and all other diſeaſes of that ſort, applyed with out for their ulcers, chancres, poula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, puſtules, within by injection, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it helps the concoction of the ſtomach, <pb facs="tcp:26125:7"/>quenches thirſt, appeaſes dolours, throwing of the belly, with Colick and Iliack paſſions: it purifies the bloud, kills and expells all kynd of wormes, chaſes away all fevers, cleanſes the skin of puſtles and skabs, be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; bathing, it louſes the belly, if bound, taking away the obſtructions from the gal, which ſends forth its choler or <hi>bilis</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſtimulus foecum in jejunum inteſtinum,</hi> wherewith being ſharpned, caſts out the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therein contained, it reſtraines the fluxes of the belly, by corroborating the retentive facultie, drying the inteſtins, and makes them ſlow to expell the humors being drawn by the force of the water to the reins and bladder, and ſo it works proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly according to the neceſſity of nature, as an excellent inſtrument appointed by Gods providence for the health of mankinde.</p>
            <p>They alſo carry with them out of the body diverſe wayes, the cold and watry bloud with other excrementitious humors of choler, pituite, melancholy. Our <hi>Hydropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae</hi> piſſe much their expulſive facultie being helped through the diuretick quality of our <pb facs="tcp:26125:8"/>water, their groſſe excrements are black or greeniſh: becauſe the ſalt of minerals be its precipitating vertue <hi>facit deſeendere terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreitatem ad fundum:</hi> ſome vomites, voyding their ſtomach of ſuperfluous humors, ſome ſweats ſending forth their obſtructions by the pores: for all diuretick things are alſo diaphoretick, the urine and ſweat being of natures little different.</p>
            <p>Theſe clear pure waters gratious both to palate and eyes provoke ſo many and divers evacuations, which ſcarce any medicament, grievous to the ſmell, horrible to the ſight, and loathſome to the taſte, could effectuate: they agree with both ſexes, all ages: reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health loſt: preſerving in integritie the preſent.</p>
            <p>Wee have uſed all kynd of tryalls for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Petrean water; and have found (as we are able to demonſtrate) that theſe waters carry with them the tincture of vitriol and of mettals not perfect nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſolide; but crude begun, growing to a ſolide mettall if every day a part were not carryed away with the waters.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26125:8"/>
            <p>As for the vertues and qualities of vitriol, they are ſo renowned by many of the ancients and all our moderne writers, that purpoſely I omit them to a more fit occaſion then the brevity of this peece can permit. And if I ſhal but point at the generation of vitriol, within the earth the underſtanding reader ſhall quickly perceave its nature and operation, which is thus.</p>
            <p>There ariſeth a ſulfureous exhalation be the action of the ſubterranean heat: which mixed with water makes a ſharp corroſive juyce, proper to corrode and drink up a part of copper and yron, and to collect and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate it ſelf in one; which we cal Vitriol. So that the principles and elements of vitriol are ſulfur, water, the two mettals of yron and copper, and ſome little portion of the minerall clay adhering either to the mettals, as ſeldome they remain in the bowels of the earth without ſome ſlimy matter: or elſe in the water with which was mixed the ſulfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous ſalſuginous exhalation, which things we ſee in the anatomy of vitriol be deſtillatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Firſt the watry part being volatile, ariſeth in <pb facs="tcp:26125:9"/>making of Colcothar, then that ſulfureous ſalſuginous exhalation, which being by cold condenſed in the recipient, turns in oyl: the
<hi>hypoſtaſis</hi> or ſediment being pulueriſed, waſhed dryed and liquified with <hi>borax, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum artem,</hi> ſhall produce a metallick ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Out of which conſiderations <hi>A. Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therus</hi> hath defined it to be <hi>ſulfureae ſalſuginis aeratae ferratae<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> coagulum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And albeit evidently <hi>ad ſenſum</hi> we can ſee no more mettals but copper and yron, yet certainly it is <hi>coagulum omnium metallorum autcorum ſal.</hi> Whence ſome have taken occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make an alluſion to the letters of <hi>Vitriolum, Viſitando interiora terrae rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cando invenies occultum lapidem veram me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the mettals, the Chimique Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay that their
<hi>proxima materia</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie engendred of the firſt matter of mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals well mixed: to wit, that viſcous humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie ſubtilly incorporate to incombuſtible earth equally mixed with the leaſt parts in the minerall concavities of the earth. And ſeeing that kinde of matter can not produce
<pb facs="tcp:26125:9"/>ſelf, nature hath given it a proper agent <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> a certain fatneſſe of the earth, engend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in its own bowels by temperate coction, for concocting, digeſting and converting the forſaid Mercurie in forme of mettall, the ſulphur having relation to the mercurie, as the male to the female, and as the proper agent to its proper matter: this is <hi>proximae materia metallorum.</hi> As in the generation of man, the aliment is a nearer mater then the elements, the bloud then the food, the ſeed then the bloud, and in end after a long and continuall digeſtion the matter receaves hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane forme: ſo in the generation of mettals there ariſeth vapors of the elements, theſe vapors being condenſed turn in a viſcous and ponderous liquor mixed with ſubtile and ſulfureous earth, which is called mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, whereof as of its <hi>proxima materia,</hi> bee the mixtion and action of ſulphur, is made gold, ſilver, yron, or any other mettall according as nature hath digeſted it leſſe or more: for there is no difference betwixt gold and yron, but that gold hath happened to bee better and longer concocted then the other.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26125:10"/>
            <p>Some ſtriving to imitate nature in perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mettals, meaning to bring them to their perfection, Gold, have uſed many arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall operations in making their Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſtone ſo much ſearched.</p>
            <p>Firſt they calcine the matter without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the body, they attenuate the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſolidity of the calcined matter by ſolution, and reduce it to its <hi>prima materia,</hi> which they call minerall water, whereof gold is the father, ſilver the mother, and quickſilver the <hi>proxeneta,</hi> that makes the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and union: this done they ſeparate the foure elements in two parts, one ſuperior and celeſtiall, which is the ſpirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, another inferior and terreſtriall which muſt bee enlived by the ſpirit making the combination with the ſoule and body, for that firſt part is a ſoul inſpired: they conjoyn the water and aire with the earth, and fire, they putrifie the matter bee a moiſt heat, after putrefaction comes coagulation, ciba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſublimation, fermentation, exaltation, augmentation, and laſtly projection upon imperfect mettals, changing them into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gold and ſilver.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26125:10"/>
            <p>It is certain that the chief end of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philoſophers, who traveiled and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured about this ſtone, was to compoſe an univerſall balſamick medicine to roborate and conſerve the radicall balſame and nectar of our life, in a good and laudable tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which great and incomparable medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine they ſearched in minerals: and knowing that gold, the perfection of minerals, could not have action in our bodys: be reaſon of its compact and firme compoſition: they have endevoured to break its hardeſt bonds, and to reduce it to its firſt matter, that it may be diſſolved in all liquors, and communicate to them that excellent and balſamick perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our life and nature.</p>
            <p>The tranſmutation of mettals in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities of the earth appears evidently; but be artificiall projection many imaginations are not ſtrong enough to conceave, though ſome too ſtrongly conceave them, &amp; by thus conceaving have deceaved many of the world and themſelves: and it is thought be many that gold is not ſo diſſolved bee any preparation as yet found out, that it renders <pb facs="tcp:26125:11"/>any tincture worthy of the leaſt and ſmaleſt part of the praiſes it receives. For <hi>in auro pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili, eſſentia auri, ſale auri,</hi> there are other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things of more worth nor the gold, lurking in another forme reducible to the metallick ſubſtance, neither perchance is it to bee denyed, but there is in gold excellent vertues and ſpecifick remedies for all kinde of diſeaſes: yea, more then in any other thing elſe, if the right and true preparation thereof were known, as it may bee future ages, more happy then wee ſhall finde, and I pray GOD they that ſpend their ſpirit and expence herein, may better themſelves, and the world.</p>
            <p>And it may be thought, if the ancients, or moderns had known that the tinctures of minerals were carryed from the concavities of the earth, with water, as in our Petrean fountain, they had never ſo perplexed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have tryed ſo many ſolutions, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinations, coagulations, fixations, ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. As they have done, evaporating their ſpirits, and exhauſting the <hi>humiàum radicale</hi> of their ſubſtance.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26125:11"/>
            <p>Within the earth from whence our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trean water flows, is a concavitie, a great veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>ampullare matratium capaciſsimum,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is contained <hi>materia proxima metallorum:</hi> which ſends forth its tincture with our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In this natural operation there is no need of calcination, ſolution, reduction to its <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma materia:</hi> and ſeparation of the foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the moſt difficile operations in the compoſition of the ſtone. And where many may erre, for here as yet the matter is not coagulate, neither is mercurie vnited to its ſalt and ſulfur: but nature finding the ſalt, ſulphur, and mercurie of minerals, as yet not vnited, conjoyns them by digeſtion and cohobation, ſublimating and ſubtilizing the earthly part, re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring the mercurial fixed, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on naturally with all the operations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the perfection of the work, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation, cibation, ſublimation, fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, exaltation, augmentation, as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it would increaſe, grow, and fill up, the whole concavities where our water is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, if there were not a continuall proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this naturall elixir, this <hi>magiſterium</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:26125:12"/>this quinteſſence of all mettals, in our water diſſolving it ſelf therein, the water being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate with this admirable yet naturall medicine, burſts out dauncing, bringing with it the cure of all diſeaſes, crying and calling all thoſe who are troubled and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with infirmities, to come and buy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money what may reſtore them to their health. And truely I may ſpeak of this ſource what ſweetly the prince of French Poets did ſing of the tree of life: neither let divins take exception that we ſymbolize from one earthly thing to another, from the tree of life to the water of life, for what is called the tree of life in the old teſtament is called the water of life in the new: both pointing out the lively vertue of our life which is hid in Chriſt: yet from the tree of life to the water of life let mee <hi>ſubſultim</hi> paſſe, as birds doe from ſprayes to brayes and from mountains to fountaines, ſaying of this water what hee ſpoke of that tree, <hi>Du Bartas.</hi> pag. 174.</p>

            <p>And thus have I ſpoken anent the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinall <pb facs="tcp:26125:17"/>vertues of this water in curing of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſeaſes, which are common to men and women: and now I muſt tell you that its vertues are not confined within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of this generalitie, that do not reach to the particular diſeaſes of the infirmer ſexe, which as it is more lovely and delicate then the other, ſo is it more opportune to the own defects, and is obnoxious to ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diſeaſes, as far different from thoſe of men, as the ſexe is from the ſexe.</p>
            <p>This water helpeth, as other common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, ſo barrenneſſe in both: but in the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſexe the <hi>pale</hi> colours, theimmoderate <hi>evacuation</hi> or <hi>retention</hi> in their deſired ſicknes, inſurrection, precipitation, ſuffocation and other diſeaſes of the mother: and in a word by removing al impediments of beauty (for diſeaſes impare the beauty with the health) makes them look clear, fair, beautifull ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like angels then mortals: in ſuch ſort that I doe not admire that many of the ancient divins affirm that the ſons of GOD, that is the angels, loved the daughters of men, and begat with them gyants. For at
<pb facs="tcp:26125:17"/>that time before the flood, the cuſtome was to drink waters, and I warrant you, the choiſeſt: which made women look ſo fair, that the angels were taken with their love: and if Angels were, it is no uncouth thing to ſee men taken with the ſame beauty.</p>

               <p>GEnerally all ſeaſons, when the weather is good, and the aire dry, and clear, are convenient to drink of this water, abſtaining when the air is ful of hanging clouds, threat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning us with rain, or foggy miſts. In win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there is more ſtrength in our water then any other time, becauſe then the ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an heat is greater, <hi>per antiperiſtaſin,</hi> ſending forth in greater abundance, the tinctures of what is there included. But becauſe in May, Iune, Iuly, Auguſt, ordinarly their is faireſt and hoteſt weather, and longeſt dayes, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving opportunitie to walk, and uſe exerciſe for helping the digeſtion of the waters, theſe months are thought fitteſt for drinking: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that all kinde of medicine in the canicular dayes with many be odious, founding on that aphoriſme of Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, <pb facs="tcp:26125:18"/>
                  <hi>exoriente cane &amp; ante canis exortum, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difficiles ſunt purgationes:</hi> meaning that the great and burning heat of that time, is able to caſt us in fevers, after any kinde of immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate evacuation, by medicine. Yet Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates doth not altogether forbid the uſe of medicine, about that time, but tells us only that it is difficult. The medicaments uſed in his time, were Hellebore, without any good preparation, or ſome ſuch other violent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, which we in this our age will uſe in no time of the year, without great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite preparation. For if he had known the uſe of <hi>Caſſia, manna, Rubarbe, ſyrup ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat, &amp;c.</hi> he had never mentioned any danger in the canicular dayes. You muſt alſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſh the place, he lived in a hote countrey, we in a cold. The moſt part of phyſicians affirme, that the ſpring and automne are the moſt proper times for medicine, becauſe then the aire is moſt temperate, without pearcing cold, or ſcorching heat: we in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are troubled at no time with heat, the ſummer diſtinguiſhed chiefly from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the longer ſojourning of the ſun in <pb facs="tcp:26125:18"/>our horizon, wherefore it is moſt agreable with reaſon to take medicine in Scotland in our hotteſt ſeaſon. When the air is too hote remain in a cold chamber: if cold, cauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come warme with fire, and in ſo doing you may ſafely purge, phlebotomiſe, ſweat, bath and ſo forth any time or ſeaſon in the year.</p>

Therefore let the medicament be proper having reſpec to the humor which is peccant. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purgation, let him come to the Well, (neither fear any <hi>Hypercatharſis</hi>) early in the morning, yet after the ſun riſing, and drink ſo much even the firſt day, while he finde his ſtomach full, not loadned, walking a little betwixt every two or three glaſſes, taking in the mean tyme, ſome confected aniſe, coriander, cinamom, or ſome good tablets proper for the diſeaſe: or tobacco to help the ſtomach to daunt and vanquiſh the actuall coldneſſe of the water; which done walk, ride, or exerciſe your ſelf with goaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bowling, or ſome ſuch other exerciſe, (for the Petrean fields are as the Eliſian, for ſuch exerciſes) whilſt the moſt part of the waters bee voyded, which will be ſo ſoone as the urine doth begin to bee coloured.

               <p>Live temperatly a long time after the drinking of the water in a clear, pure, wholeſome aire to breath on: eating meats of good digeſtion to ſuffice nature, not gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die appetit: ſleeping to refreſh, not to dull your ſpirits: waking to drive away ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, dulneſſe, and drowſineeſſe from your braines, not to waſt, conſume, and dry your bodies: uſing exerciſe for recreation, not to weary: taking reſt for a remeed to your wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, reſtoring ſtrength, that your bodies may be made more fit, to indure new travels and labours: avoyde repletion of the belly, inteſtins and veins, by moderate evacuation of nature, and if ſlow, make help by art: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb facs="tcp:26125:20"/>violent, to reſolve your ſpirits, or to evacuate with excrements your ſouls.
